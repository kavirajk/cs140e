# A toy Operating system for Raspberry Pi

It is based on course [cs140e](https://cs140e.sergio.bz/assignments/1-shell/).

This repository will eventually contains, all the assignments with all the questions answered to my knowledge.

One major update from the original source is, all the code in this repo made to work with `Rust 2018 edition` with latest `nightly`

```bash
-bash-5.0$ rustc --version
rustc 1.46.0-nightly (2753fab7c 2020-07-05)

-bash-5.0$ cargo --version
cargo 1.46.0-nightly (fede83ccf 2020-07-02)
-bash-5.0$
```
